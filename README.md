## Hi! My name is Poppy ðŸ‘‹

### Junior Software Developer and Mentor at Northcoders

I've spent almost 2 years training and mentoring hundreds of adults from all different walks of life on their journey from beginners to landing their first developer roles. I've also been developing the applications that ware used every day on the bootcamp, such as our learner management web application.

I'm currently working on 2 projects:
  - ðŸ’Ž **pawprint** : A full-stack application designed as a luxury clothing store... for cats! This was designed as a UI/UX research project involving implementation of Nielsen's heuristics and design of high-fidelity wireframes in Figma. It is built with the t3 stack (TypeScript, Next.js, Prisma)
  - ðŸŽµ **DanceTracker** : A full-stack application built to keep track of exercises for conditioning and muscle building for dance primarily, but this will expand to incorporating a social forum, challenges, and a competition tracker. This is to practice writing clean code which can be expanded upon with new features without breaking old functionality. Built with C# / ASP.NET with a Blazor frontend.


When I'm not working on any of these things, you can find me competing in Irish Dancing (to varying degrees of success), learning languages, or drawing.

**I'm currently in the process of moving some of my repositiories onto this GitHub account to have them all in one place, so watch this space!ðŸ‘€**
